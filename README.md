# Breast Cancer Predictor

This project involves the use of machine learning techniques to analyze breast cancer data, identify patterns, and make predictions.

## Files in the Repository

- `Breast_Cancer.py`: This script contains the code for analyzing the breast cancer data using machine learning.
- `breast-cancer.csv`: This dataset contains the breast cancer data used in the analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these using pip:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

## Running the Analysis

- git clone https://github.com/Mahesh-Pawar-02/Breast_Cancer_Predictor.git
- cd Breast_Cancer_Predictor


- Dataset
- The breast-cancer.csv file contains the following columns:

- Column1: Description of column 1
- Column2: Description of column 2
- ...
- ColumnN: Description of column N
- (Note: Replace the column descriptions with the actual columns in your dataset.)

- Machine Learning Workflow
- The analysis script performs the following steps:

- Data Loading: Loads the breast cancer dataset.
- Data Cleaning: Handles missing values and cleans the dataset.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generates visualizations to understand the data.
- Feature Engineering: Creates new features from existing data.
- Model Training: Trains machine learning models to make predictions.
- Evaluation: Evaluates the models using appropriate metrics.
